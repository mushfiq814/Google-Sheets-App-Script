# Google Sheets App Script for formatting Square Appointments History Export

This is a JavaScript script I'm working on to format a Google Sheets Spreadsheet. This is mostly just playing around with Google App Script and getting used to the Sheets API. I am also trying to find better algorithms to make the script run in next to no time! This script helps the Administration staff at my company work faster by having all the information they want to view automatically update every day.
